- CG with rel. accuracy 10^-8
- standard V-cycle
- 2 pre- and post-smoothing steps

* exac:
  exact local solver

* bila:
  inexact local solver: separable rank-2 kronecker decomposition based on
  bilaplacian (mixed contribution including laplacians are omitted)

* KSVD: WIP
  * best rank-1 approximation:
    rank-1 KSVD of local matrices, fast inversion via tensor-aware eigendecomposition... WIP

  * best rank-2 approximation (cutting of negative eigenvalues):
    compute rank-2 KSVD of local matrices, fast inversion via tensor-aware
    generalized eigendecomposition (we cut off all negative inverse eigenvalues
    to guarantee positive definiteness)... WIP

  * suboptimal rank-2 approximation:
    compute rank-3 KSVD of local matrices, take first and third tensor as local
    approximations which guarantees a positive definite approximation, fast
    inversion via tensor-aware generalized eigendecomposition... WIP
