- Hermite-like DGQ elements
- m_pre = 2 and m_post = 2
- gmres solver with 10^-8 accuracy
- coarse gmres solver with 10^-12 accuracy
- coarse grid is 2 x 2 x 2
- user-defined coloring (avoiding race conditions)

variants:

* (1) xdamp (standard additive Schwarz + damping)
- different damping factor in 2D and 3D (...xdamp)
- computed on simserv02 40 procs x 4 threads = 160 threads

* (2) RASw (restricted additive Schwarz + weighted partition of unity)
- see thesis or TPSS lib for details
- computed on simserv02 40 procs x 4 threads = 160 threads

* (3) RASb (restricted additive Schwarz + boolean partition of unity)
- see thesis or TPSS lib for details
- computed on simserv02 160 threads
