- CG with rel. accuracy 10^-8
- standard V-cycle
- 2 pre- and post-smoothing steps (reverse for post)

assembled on simserv02:
- *.tab missing for degree 7 since we ran out of memory

* exact:
  - local mesh_loop() used for assembly
  - SVD of complete local block system with kernel size 1 
  (if SVD computations fail one might rescale pressure coefficients to separate the spectrum of eigenvalues of the local block system)
